Schools are burdened with the task of creating functional people. Society desires more bodies to make more bodies to fill the 5,400,000 great open jobs in the United States. The classroom time is better utilized giving them marketable skills. Once the students get the jobs and the salaries they'll use the income to learn about money. The best way to learn anything is through experience. The experience of investing, spending, and earning will teach this and future generations as it has taught past generations about money.

Those that sell vices. Profit from wants.

## Fitting Money Into The Current Curriculum

The cool thing about learning about money is that it may be applied to any subject. Reading business cases and stories about money will help with reading, reasoning and descision making skills. Math. Well adding, subtracting, and working on money problems. How do crimes get solved? How do reporters break stories? **Follow the Money. **Teach people how to follow the money and the rest will work itself out. Children and most individuals have a natural interest in money. They're curious, we're all curious. Even those of us that think **It's Evil. **Teach them about money so that they may talk about how evil it is.

## Don't Teach Children About Money

We need to teach children about value. Teach how value is created and destroyed. Teach about value because value attracts money. Value is a leading indicator of where money is going.
