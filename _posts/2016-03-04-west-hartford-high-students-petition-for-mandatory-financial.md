West Hartford High School Students Petition For Mandatory Financial Literacy Class - Courant Community

I teach financial literacy to 3rd-5th graders at a Title 1 school, Hirsch Academy in Scottsdale Arizona. The 5th graders are in their third year of the program. I'm curious to see how their decisions will be similar or differ from their peers in 10-20 years. I hope they stay in contact with each other and join together to be a major force in their communities.

Only time will tell.

\#Onward.

Don't Be Good. Be Great. Be Grateful.
